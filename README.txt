Simple Sudoku Solving Algorithm

    It reads a .txt file containing 9x9 numeric elements and outputs a solution or none.
    The algorithm uses recursion and backtracking to ensure there will be an answer whenever possible.
    The algorithm only works on 9x9 (for now)

Future additions(?)

    Use computer vision to read a sudoku from an image and output the answer from it
